  "year-2038-problem": "What is the Year 2038 problem?",

  "timestamp-formats-question": "What are the different timestamp formats?",
  "timestamp-formats-explanation": "Common timestamp formats include: Seconds (10 digits) - standard Unix timestamp; Milliseconds (13 digits) - JavaScript Date.now(); Microseconds (16 digits) - higher precision timing; Nanoseconds (19 digits) - ultra-precise measurements. Each format represents time elapsed since the Unix epoch.",
  "timestamp-validation-question": "How do I validate a timestamp?",
  "timestamp-validation-explanation": "A valid timestamp should be a positive integer within reasonable bounds. For seconds format (10 digits), values should be between 0 and 2147483647 (before Year 2038). For milliseconds (13 digits), multiply by 1000. Always check if the resulting date makes sense for your use case.",
  "utc-vs-local-question": "What is UTC vs local time?",
